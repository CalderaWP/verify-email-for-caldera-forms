== Description ==

A form processor for [Caldera Forms](https://calderaforms.com?utm_source=dotOrg&utm_medium=plugins&utm_campaign=cf-verify-email) that sends a validation link to the submitters email address to verify the email entered is valid. Once the link is clicked, the form submission is completed.
This can be used for both anti-spam and confirming the email address is correct before sending the form.
